# üîÄ Pull Request DashBoard

A GitHub Pull Request management tool built by Team 04 during Chingu Voyage 57 - Tier 1.

## üîç Overview

As junior developers learning to work in teams, we realized how important it is to stay on top of pull requests. This project gave us the opportunity to develop a clear, visual way to track PRs, reviews, and comments in our repository. 

We built this tool to help development teams quickly see the status of all PRs at a glance. It's designed to make code review workflows more transparent and manageable.

This was the first time any of us worked on a collaborative project! It helped us learn React, Tailwind CSS, work with APIs, and practice real-world Git workflows.

## üöÄ Features

- **View Pull Requests**: Display all open or closed PRs from a team's GitHub repository
- **Search Functionality**: Filter PRs by title, author, or description
- **Detailed PR Information**: See reviews, comments, and status for each PR 
- **Accessible Design**: Includes ARIA labels and full keyboard navigation support 
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches live data directly from GitHub's API
- **Clean UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, professional look

## üìà Running the Project

Want to run this project locally? Follow these steps:

### üìú Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your computer
- A GitHub Personal Access Token ([How to create one](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens))

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/V57-tier1-team-04 
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
   ```
   VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   VITE_GITHUB_ORG=your_github_organization
   VITE_GITHUB_REPO_NAME=your_repository_name
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal)

6. **Deploy**
   We chose Vercel. To use Vercel, import the repo, set environment variables, and deploy.

## üß© Dependencies

This project was built with the following technologies:

- [React](https://react.dev/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Fast build tool and development server
- [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js) - GitHub's official API client for JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

## üß† What We Learned

As a team of junior developers, this project taught us:

- How to work collaboratively using Git and GitHub (branches, PRs, code reviews)
- Using React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback`
- Making API calls and handling asynchronous data with `async/await`
- Error handling with try/catch blocks
- Component-based architecture in React
- Implementing accessibility best practices with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- The importance of clear communication and documentation
