# 🔀 Merge Monitor

A GitHub Pull Request management tool built by Team 04 during Chingu Voyage 57 - Tier 1.

## Overview

As junior developers learning to work in teams, we realized how important it is to stay on top of pull requests. This project gave us the opportunity to develop a clear, visual way to track PRs, reviews, and comments in our repository. 

We built this tool to help development teams quickly see the status of all PRs at a glance. It's designed to make code review workflows more transparent and manageable.

This was the first time any of us worked on a collaborative project! It helped us learn React, Tailwind CSS, work with APIs, and practice real-world Git workflows.

## Features

- **View Pull Requests**: Display all open or closed PRs from a team's GitHub repository
- **Search Functionality**: Filter PRs by title, author, or description
- **Detailed PR Information**: See reviews, comments, and status for each PR 
- **Accessible Design**: Includes ARIA labels and full keyboard navigation support 
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches live data directly from GitHub's API
- **Clean UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, professional look

## Running the Project

Want to run this project locally? Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your computer
- A GitHub Personal Access Token ([How to create one](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens))

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/V57-tier1-team-04 
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:
   ```
   VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   VITE_GITHUB_ORG=your_github_organization
   VITE_GITHUB_REPO_NAME=your_repository_name
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal)

## Dependencies

This project was built with the following technologies:

- [React](https://react.dev/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Fast build tool and development server
- [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js) - GitHub's official API client for JavaScript
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

## What We Learned

As a team of junior developers, this project taught us:

- How to work collaboratively using Git and GitHub (branches, PRs, code reviews)
- Using React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback`
- Making API calls and handling asynchronous data with `async/await`
- Error handling with try/catch blocks
- Component-based architecture in React
- Implementing accessibility best practices with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- The importance of clear communication and documentation
