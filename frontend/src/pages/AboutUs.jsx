        <p>
This project was built by four junior developers 👩‍💻👨‍💻 as a part of Chingu Voyage 57, Tier 1. </p>

<p>We worked collaboratively 🤝 to create a PR status monitoring tool, merging our different strengths and skills 💪. 
        </p>
        <p>Each member of the team contributed to the design and development of the applications in order to create a functional and user-friendly final product ✨. </p>
        <p>Using Scrum ceremonies, we were able to get organized 📋 and tackle optional features as well. We are excited to share our work with you! 🎉</p>
